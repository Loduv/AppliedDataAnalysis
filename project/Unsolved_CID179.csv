The N’Sele ceasefire agreement was the first of the six protocols included in the final Arusha Accords of 1993.The agreement regulated the conflict behaviour of the parties through establishing a ceasefire and a cessation of hostilities to be monitored by a Neutral Military Observer Group, comprised of personnel from Nigeria, Senegal, Zimbabwe, the OAU and representatives of the warring parties. The agreement also established a Neutral Corridor, separating the opposing armies.

Further, a Joint Political Military Commission, composed of representatives of the belligerents, was established to ensure the follow-up of the ceasefire agreement and the comprehensive peace agreement yet to be signed.

Lastly the agreement outlined a short agenda for further talks, specifying that rule of law and democracy should be created, that the formation of a new national army should commence and the a power-sharing arrangement would be established to regulate the incompatibility.","For the Rwandese Government:

The agreement is the second protocol that was included in the final peace agreement of 1993 (the Arusha Accords).

The agreement outlined the basic principles that should guide the country’s politics once the conflict was ended. The parties agreed that the rule of law would reign supreme through the establishment of pluralistic democracy, human rights and national unity. Political parties should be allowed for under law and the judiciary should be made to be independent. The agreement firmly stated the rejection of ideologies based on ethnicity, religion or intolerance.

To approach the goal of such reconciliation and unity a National Commission on Human Rights was established, and all refugees were to be encouraged to return to take part in the democratic process.","For and on behalf of the Government of the Republic of Rwanda:

This agreement is the fifth protocol that was included in the Arusha Accords of 1993. The agreement focuses on demobilization of forces and the formation of a new national army.

The agreement regulates all sectors of the armed forces; the military, the police and the gendarmerie. All troops involved in the conflict are to relocate to cantonment points to await demobilization or integration into the stipulated new national army. Quotas are specified for this integration, stating that 60% of the military forces will be government troops and 40% will be rebel troops. The command structure is to be based on an equal quota. The same quotas are applied for integration into the National Gendarmerie; the national police force of Rwanda. The agreement also stipulates the doctrine, training program and other specifications for the entire process of the formation of a new army. The implementation of these modalities, and the general supervision of the final peace agreement, are to be supervised by an Neutral International Force, supplied by the UN.

The demobilization programme agreed upon posits a wide number of activities, such as demobilization allowances according to rank, social reintegration and job opportunities for those demobilized.

The Arusha Accords were signed 4 August 1993. It lasted less than a month - the implementation of the peace agreement was prepared, but never fulfilled. The Arusha Accords comprised a general agreement and six attached protocols that were all combined into a whole to form this comprehensive agreement.

The first point of interest in the agreement was the parties reaffirming the N´Sele Ceasefire Agreement, which instated a Neutral Corridor separating the warring parties from each other. The corridor, and the observance of the ceasefire, was to be monitored by the Neutral Military Observer Group. A unified national army was stipulated, and the government was to contribute 60% of the forces and the FPR 40%. The same formula was applied for the police force, and all other types of uniformed forces. The military pact was of an extensive nature, with military power-sharing also applied to military training schools and other facilities. The combatants that would not be integrated were to become subject to a DDR program which included demobilization allowances and social, economic and educational training.

A power-sharing arrangement was agreed upon in the political sphere to resolve the incompatibility. The president and prime minister were to be chosen through a process of consensus, ministerial portfolios were distributed between all the participating parties (with the FPR receiving five such portfolios) and the seats in the assembly were to be shared according to a similar formula (the FPR being granted 11 seats). The new Prime Minister was to be installed by 10 September. Multiparty general elections were to take place after a 22-month period, during which the power-sharing arrangements would be in force.

Finally, the agreement allowed for repatriation of all Rwandan refugees and the return of internally displaced persons to their homes. The CDR, an extremist party which broke out from the MRND, and which claimed to represent the interests of the Hutu majority, refused to participate in any future Assembly.",President Juvénal Habyarimana signed for the Rwandan government and Col.
