pa_comment,"Partial peace agreement
The San Andrés Accords contained a number of agreements between the government of Mexico and the EZLN, all related to issues of the indigenous people, increased democratic rights and a solution to the problem of poverty.

A number of suggested constitutional amendments were agreed upon through the signing of the accords, with provisions for a number of reforms. Among these reforms the most prominent were acts to recognize the indigenous peoples in the constitution, to broaden their political participation and representation, to increase their cultural rights and to decentralize the structure of the state of Mexico. Deals were also made to better the situation of the indigenous peoples and the poor in respect to employment, education and equality before the law. A new relationship between the different levels of government authority was established, devolving powers to the municipalities and allowing municipalities dominated by indigenous people to govern themselves in some respects such as culture and traditions.

In short the agreement covered indigenous rights and culture and strengthened the position of the indigenous people in Mexico."
