# Does the United Nations peace agreements have an impact in conflicts resolution around the world ?

# Abstract
The United Nations often gets criticized for all the wars it could not prevent and its impact in our society has often been questionned. Our study will aim at giving a rational analysis of the impact of UN peace agreements on the evolution of conflicts around the world. The results of our analysis will be presented as a data story: we will display information relative to both conflicts and peace treaties on a world map to have an insight on the impact they have on one another. We will use a time slider to show the evolution of the aforementioned data through time. We can go further on this analysis by showing the evolution of migration flows from countries at war.

TODO : time range + UCDP dataset (brief description)

# Research questions
A list of research questions you would like to address during the project.

- What are the biggest conflicts?
  - What are the casualties?
  - How do they evolve? 
- What percentage of conflicts benefited from UN peace agreements?
- What impact do peace agreements have on conflicts? 
  - Do they bring stability? 
  - For how long?
- How do conflicts/peace treaties influence migration flows?

# Dataset
To fulfill our research goals, we will use the Uppsala Conflict Data Program (UCDP) dataset. The UCDP is a data collection project on organized violence that has been collecting information on armed conflict since 1946. As the UN has been created in 1945, the data set allows us to answer our problematic correctly. We will mainly use the UCDP Georeferenced Event Dataset (GED) which gives a lot of informations (including geographical coordinates) about every conflicts that happened from 1946 and the UCDP peace agreement dataset that gives us informations on how these conflicts were solved. We can link peace agreements to conflict events thanks to the conflict ID.
We used the codebooks available on the UCDP website to fully understand these datasets, the data that is available and how it is organised. 
Our first idea is to use the UCDP GED to get informations about all the conflicts (mainly casualties and location) and then use the UCDP peace agreements dataset to see which of theses conflicts were resolved and if some new conflicts appears at the same location shortly after.



List the dataset(s) you want to use, and some ideas on how do you expect to get, manage, process and enrich it/them. Show us you've read the docs and some examples, and you've a clear idea on what to expect. Discuss data size and format if relevant.

# A list of internal milestones up until project milestone 2
- Clean dataset
- Prepare data for mapping
- Descriptive statistics
- Make an interactive geographical map of violent events trhoughout time.
- Add the peace agreements to the map
- Analyze correlations of the violence level increase or decrease with the peace agreements.
