# Does the United Nations peace agreements have an impact in conflicts resolution around the world ?

# Abstract
The United Nations often gets criticized for all the wars it could not prevent and its impact in our society has often been questionned. Our study will aim at giving a rational analysis of the impact of UN peace agreements on the evolution of conflicts around the world. We will display information relative to both conflicts and peace treaties around the world to have an insight on the impact they have on one another. We will use a time slider to show the evolution of the aforementioned data through time. The results of our analysis will be presented as a data story. We can go further on this analysis by showing the evolution of migration flows from countries at war.


First, we will observe the evolution of conflicts and the ratified UN peace treaties together. We will display a data stroy 

We would like to track the evolution of conflicts and peace treaties through time in the same world map. A time slider will allow the user to observe those evolutions. We will then link it to UN peace agreements and compare the growth or decay of violence in the concerned regions.  Thus, we will display this information  and use a time slider to display it. 

Also, we would like to understand the similarities between violent events.

We would like to establish a graph where those violent events are nodes and the edges are the similarity between them. They could hold as attributes the actors of the event, the intermediaries, the geological position, the side parties intervening etc...

# Research questions
A list of research questions you would like to address during the project. 
- Does a peace treaty from the Un enables to acquire stabiity in a given region and for how long ?
- Are there levels in the peace treaties that can lead to predict how big will be its impact ?

# Dataset
To fulfill our research goals, we will use the UCDP dataset. This dataset is composed of multiple csv files that can be linked together via dyads. A dyad consists of two conflicting primary parties. This dataset being quite small, we will not have to use the EPFL cluster to pursue our studies. If time allows it, we would like to investigate on the GDELT and UCDP dataset the patterns and signatures of **violent events** and see if we can define structures and repeating processes.

List the dataset(s) you want to use, and some ideas on how do you expect to get, manage, process and enrich it/them. Show us you've read the docs and some examples, and you've a clear idea on what to expect. Discuss data size and format if relevant.

# A list of internal milestones up until project milestone 2
- Clean dataset
- Prepare data for mapping
- Descriptive statistics
- Make an interactive geographical map of violent events trhoughout time.
- Add the peace agreements to the map
- Analyze correlations of the violence level increase or decrease with the peace agreements.
