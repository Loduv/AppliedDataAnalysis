# Does the United Nations peace agreements have an impact in conflicts resolution around the world ?

# Abstract
The United Nations often gets criticized for all the wars it could not prevent and its impact in our society is questionned. Our study will aim at giving a rational opinion in the impact of UN peace agreements and the development of wars. First we will make a map display of all violent events through history. We will then connect it to UN peace agreements and compare the growth or decay of violence in the concerned region. Also, we would like to understand the similarities between violent events. We would like to establish a graph where those violent events are nodes and the edges are the similarity between them. They could hold as attributes the actors of the event, the intermediaries, the geological position, the side parties intervening etc...

# Research questions
A list of research questions you would like to address during the project. 

# Dataset
To fulfill our research goals, we will muse the UCDP dataset. This dataset is composed of multiple csv files that can be linked together via dyads. A dyad consists of two conflicting primary parties. This dataset being quite small, we will not have to use the EPFL cluster to pursue our studies. AS the UCDP dataset holds a collection of violent events starting from 1946, we might enrich the datset with the Gdelt dataset.

List the dataset(s) you want to use, and some ideas on how do you expect to get, manage, process and enrich it/them. Show us you've read the docs and some examples, and you've a clear idea on what to expect. Discuss data size and format if relevant.

# A list of internal milestones up until project milestone 2
Make an interactive geographical map of violent events trhoughout time.
Add the peace agreements to the map
Analyze correlations of the violence level increase or decrease with the peace agreements.
Add here a sketch of your planning for the next project milestone.
